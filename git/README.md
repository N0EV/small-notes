# Basic Git Commands and How to Use Them

Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Here are some of the most fundamental Git commands, their purposes, and example usages.

## 1. `git status`

**Purpose:** Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files arenâ€™t being tracked by Git.

**Example:**
```sh
git status
```
*Output:*  
Displays a list of changed files, files to be committed, and files not staged for commit.

## 2. `git init`

**Purpose:** Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

**Example:**
```sh
git init
```
*Output:*  
Creates a new `.git` folder in your project, making it a Git repository.

## 3. `git clone`

**Purpose:** Creates a copy of a remote repository locally.

**Example:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
*Output:*  
Copies all files and history from the remote repository to a local folder named `repo`.

---

## 4. `git add`

**Purpose:** Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.

**Example (add a specific file):**
```sh
git add filename.txt
```
**Example (add all changes):**
```sh
git add .
```
*Output:*  
Files are staged and ready to be committed.

## 5. `git commit`

**Purpose:** Records the staged changes to the repository history with a descriptive message.

**Example:**
```sh
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```
*Output:*  
A new commit is created with the provided message.

## 6. `git push`

**Purpose:** Uploads your local commits to the remote repository.

**Example:**
```sh
git push origin main
```
*Output:*  
Your commits are sent to the `main` branch on the remote repository named `origin`.

---

## 7. `git pull`

**Purpose:** Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

**Example:**
```sh
git pull origin main
```
*Output:*  
Downloads new commits from the remote `main` branch and merges them into your current branch.
